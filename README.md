# Executive Summary

The West Nile Virus (WNV), which first originated in the West Nile area (Uganda) of Africa in 1937, recently made its way to the United States. The major vector for WNV are the mosquito species *Culex Pipiens* and *Culex Restuans*. The pathogen is further amplified by birds when they get bitten by an infected mosquito. A large majority (about 80%) of people infected with WNV are asymptomatic. In general, the illness is not life threatening with those who exhibit symptoms experiencing fevers and aches and then fatigue which may last for several weeks. However those aged 60 and above are at an increased risk of developing complications in the central nervous system, which can lead to permanent damage or even death.

The windy city, Chicago, is ranked as one of the worst cities in USA for mosquito infestation. As such, the risk of transmission and propagation of WNV is a matter of serious concern. Each year, Chicago's Department of Public Health deploys workers to set up mosquito traps throughout the city to collect mosquitos to test for the presence of WNV. 

A new data science team was formed within the Disease And Treatment Agency, division of Societal Cures In Epidemiology and New Creative Engineering (DATA-SCIENCE) to utilize the collected data, along with data from the 2 weather stations in Chicago, to predict when WNV outbreaks are likely to occur each year. A predictive model was developed using Adaptive Boost Classifier and optimized for sensitivity.

The project is divided into two separate notebooks:
- Data Cleaning and EDA
- Modelling and Evaluation

# Problem Statement

With the recent rise in cases of WNV in Chicago, DATA-SCIENCE has initiated a project to construct a machine learning model to predict the occurence of WNV in the City. Current pesticide application practices do not appear to be effective in curbing the spread of the virus. This project aims to use the findings from machine learning to devise a more effective strategy to annual pesticide application in Chicago.

### Objectives

- Accurately predict the occurance of WNV
- Optimize model for sensitivity
- Recommend spraying strategy

### Stakeholders

- Disease and Treatment Agency, division of Societal Cures in Epidemiology and New Creative Engineering (DATA-SCIENCE)
- Department of Public Health Chicago
- Chicago Citizens
